              Through the monthly payment packages, the user will be able to
              access coupons with offers to be redeemed at local businesses
              throughout Worcester County, Massachusetts. Through the coupons,
              local businesses throughout Worcester County offer deals,
              discounts and incentives for users who purchase the packages on
              the platform.
            </p>
            <p>WOO-PONS offers the following monthly payment packages:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Silver & Gold (Users)</li>
              <li>Bronze & Platinum (Business owners)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The Silver package includes one coupon (Woo-Pon) per week and the
              Gold package includes unlimited coupons per week.
            </p>
            <p>
              The user can access a 30-day free trial before upgrading to any
              paid package. The user can cancel the free trial at any time
              before moving to a paid package. When a user purchases a package,
              WOO-PONS will send a confirmation email. This confirmation email
              will occur automatically so that the user has confirmation of the
              payment and the start of the package. If the user does not receive
              the email confirmation of the purchase and the start of the
              package, it is possible that it has been sent to your spam folder.
            </p>
            <p>
              WOO-PONS may change or discontinue the availability of packages at
              any time at its sole discretion. If a package purchase is
              cancelled, the payment made for the package will be refunded in
              the applicable billing period. This does not affect your statutory
              rights.
            </p>
            <p>
              Packages include automatic recurring payments. You authorize
              WOO-PONS to renew your package and to charge you monthly on each
              billing date (every 30 days). The billing date of the package is
              the date on which you purchase the package and make the first
              payment. On the applicable billing date, you will automatically be
              charged the applicable package rate. The package will remain
              active until you cancel it or we terminate it. You must cancel the
              package before it renews to avoid the next billing period. We will
              bill you for the package billing fee in the payment method you
              choose during registration and package purchase.
            </p>
            <p>
              Packages will automatically renew for an additional billing period
              unless cancelled prior to the next billing period. Users may
              cancel the package through the user account settings in the
              billing section or by submitting a cancellation request through
              our contact information and the package will be cancelled for the
              next billing period. If a package is cancelled, the user will be
              able to continue to use the payment features of the package until
              the next billing period, at which time the package and access to
              the payment features of the platform will be cancelled.

            <p>Packages can be paid through the following payment methods:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Credit/debit card (Visa, Master, Discover, Amex, Diners, etc.)
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              Package payment will be processed through our payment processor
              Stripe. The package payment will be charged to your credit/debit
              card immediately after completing the payment process for the
              corresponding package after the free trial period is over. The
              package will be activated upon completion of the payment process
              and will be charged on each billing date automatically. Once the
              transaction is processed, we will send an electronic receipt to
              the user's email address.
            </p>
            <p>
              If you find any inconsistencies in your billing, please contact us
              via our contact details or you can make a complaint via the
              customer service of the relevant payment processor.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your card is declined, you will receive an error message. No
              payment will be charged to your card and no order will be
              processed. There may be a pending transaction on your account
              until your card issuing bank withdraws the authorization. This
              usually takes 2 to 5 working days. Your card may be declined for a
              number of reasons, such as insufficient funds, AVS (Address
              Verification System) mismatch or you have entered an incorrect
              security code.
            </p>
            <p>
              If your payment is declined, you will need to provide an
              alternative payment method or provide another card on which the
              payment can be charged and processed.
            </p>
            <p>
              Your payment details will be treated and retained securely and for
              the sole purpose of processing the purchase of the packages.
              WOO-PONS reserves the right to engage any payment platform
              available on the market, which processes your data for the sole
              purpose of processing the purchase of the packages.
