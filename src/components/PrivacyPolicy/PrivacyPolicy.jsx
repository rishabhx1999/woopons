                Right to be informed: Users of our platform will be informed,
                upon request, about what data we collect, how it is used, how
                long it is retained and whether it is shared with third parties.

              <li>
                Object: When we process your information based on our legitimate
                interests as explained above, or in the public interest, you may
                object to this processing in certain circumstances. In such
                cases, we will stop processing your information unless we have
                compelling legitimate reasons to continue processing it or where
                it is necessary for legal reasons.

              <li>
                Revoke consent: Where you have previously given your consent,
                such as to allow us to process and store your personal
                information, you have the right to revoke your consent to the
                processing and storage of your information at any time. For
                example, you may withdraw your consent by updating your
                settings. In certain cases, we may continue to process your
                information after you have withdrawn your consent if we have a
                legal basis for doing so or if your withdrawal of consent was
                limited to certain processing activities.
              </li>
              <li>
                Complaint: If you wish to file a complaint about our use of your
                information (and without prejudice to any other rights you may
                have), you have the right to do so with your local supervisory
                authority. Users can exercise all these rights by contacting us
                through the contact information or the contact page.

                Rights related to automated decision-making, including
                profiling: Platform users may request that we provide a copy of
                the automated processing activities we conduct if they believe
                that data is being unlawfully processed.

              We comply with the requirements of the data protection regulations

              personal data of minors. Although the platform and content are

              under the age of 13 has provided us with personal information
              without the permission of his or her parent or legal guardian,
              please contact us. If we become aware that a minor has provided us
              with personal information without the permission of a parent or
              legal guardian, we will take steps to delete that information,
              terminate that person's account, and restrict access to that
              person's account.
